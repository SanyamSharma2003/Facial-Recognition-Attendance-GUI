## FACIAL RECOGNITION ATTENDANCE GUI
This is a Desktop Application on Face Recognition using Python, openCV and PyQt Designer for creating the GUI. This application captures your face in the camera and calculates its face-encodings and matches with the known faces-encodings and gives the output accordingly. Now if the known face want to clock-in or clock-out, he/she can clock-in or clock-out and the time for clock in and clock-out will be calculated and it will be updated in the Attendance.csv file(You can open this file in xl also). In the Attendance.csv file, we have name, time, status, i.e. we have clock-in time as well as clock-out time in the Attendence.csv file. I have explained the code in comments. Please go through the same for detailed understanding of the code.


Kindly use "Visual Studio Code" to run this GUI Desktop App as it will be easier to run as I am giving the requirements according to VSCode and make sure you have installed the appropriate extensions(.py, .ui, .csv, .png, .jpg, .qrc) in VSCode so that the files uploaded here will run appropriately.

## To Install the Facial Recognition Libraries Dependencies
You will need the following:

"pip install dlib"

"pip install face-recognition"

## To Install the PyQt Libraries Dependencies and tools
You will need the following:

"pip install pyqt5"

"pip install pyqt5-tools"

NOTE: Use "Python 3.9" version in your PC or Desktop as you may encounter error while you are installing pyqt5-tools in your command prompt or in VSCode terminal for           Python 3.10 and above versions.

## To Install the openCV
"pip install opencv-python"
